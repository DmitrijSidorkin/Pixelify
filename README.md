    Pixelify is a simple app that uses RAWG.io API to fetch random video game data, and turns it into a quiz with a pixelated image of a video game and 4 guesses to chose from. It also has global highscore tracking for registered users and after the quiz session detailed information for every pixelated game can be viewed.
